# Jeddah Emergency Response Simulation

This project simulates the urban street grid of Jeddah, incorporating precise locations of ambulance stations and hospitals. It aims to optimize emergency response times by analyzing and improving ambulance fleet management and distribution.

## Features

- Accurate simulation of Jeddah's street network
- Dynamic management of ambulance fleets
- Analysis of response times and identification of bottlenecks
- Suggestions for strategic improvements in resource allocation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run the main simulation script:

```
python src/main.py
```
